# marcssist

Turn a JavaScript object with CSS styles into a class in a stylesheet.

# Example

    var mx = window.marcssist;
    var buttonStyle = {
      background: "red",
      color: "yellow",
      padding: "1em"
    };
    var buttonClass = mx.add(buttonStyle);
    myDiv.classList.add(buttonClass);


# Why?

When writing an application where the DOM is generated by JavaScript, defining styles where you define your views are often convenient. Rather than applying de-facto inline styles with classes such as `text-lowercase` and `pull-left`, you might just as well embrace inline styles.

Using JavaScript to define your styles also gives you the full power of a familiar programming language to inherit, extend and manipulate your styles.

The `style` attribute has some limitations, like the inability to add pseudo classes. Manipulating many individual style properties can also have performance implications. marcssist lets you write class-less styles, just as Marx intended, without giving away the power of CSS.


# API

## marcssist.add(style)

Add a style object, returning a class name used to apply the styles.


## marcssist(options)

Create a new instance of marcssist with the supplied options. Valid options and their defaults are:

 * `prefix` = true


## Advanced examples

Any property whose value is an object will get "expanded" to a child selector.

    var buttonStyle = {
      background: "red",
      padding: "1em",
      a: {
        color: "yellow",
        ":hover": { color: "black" }
      }
    };
    var buttonClass = mx.add(buttonStyle);

    // Produces the rules:
    // .mx__0 { background: red; padding: 1em }
    // .mx__0 a { color: yellow }
    // .mx__0 a:hover { color: black }
 

## Vendor prefixing

Which vendor prefix to use and for which properties is determined at the first call to `add()`. It's done by looping through all style properties on an element, and if a `-*-` prefixed property does not exist unprefixed, it's registered as needing a prefix. The procedure for values is similar, testing if a property value that doesn't work unprefixed works with the current vendor prefix.
