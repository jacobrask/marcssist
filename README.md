# marcssist

Turn a JavaScript object with CSS styles into a class in a stylesheet.

# Example

    var mx = window.marcssist;
    var buttonClass = mx.style({
      color: "yellow",
      padding: 10,
      ":hover" { color: "black" }
    });
    myDiv.classList.add(buttonClass);
    // .mx__0 { color: yellow; padding: 10px }
    // .mx__0:hover { color: black }


# Why?

When writing an application where the DOM is generated by JavaScript, defining styles where you define your views are often convenient. Rather than applying de-facto inline styles with classes such as `text-lowercase` and `pull-left`, you might just as well embrace inline styles.

Using JavaScript to define your styles also gives you the full power of a familiar programming language to inherit, extend and manipulate your styles.

The `style` attribute has some limitations, like the inability to add pseudo classes. Manipulating many individual style properties can also have performance implications. marcssist lets you write class-less styles, just as Marx intended, without giving away the power of CSS.


# API

## `marcssist.add(style)`

Add a style object, returning a class name used to apply the styles. If `style` is an array, the properties are added left-to-right, with the properties on the last object overriding existing ones.

    mx.style([{ width: 1 }, { width: 2 }]);
    // .mx__1 { width: 2px }


## `marcssist(options)`

Create a new instance of marcssist with the supplied options. Valid options and their defaults are:

 * Vendor prefixing: `prefix = true`
 * Auto units: `unit = "px"`


## Nested selectors

If an object is passed as a value to a key, the key is considered a selector instead of a CSS property. It is simply treated as a new style block, but with the key appended to the returned class name. All selectors not starting with `:` or `[` will automatically be separated by whitespace.

    mx.style({ background: "red", a: { ":hover": color: "blue" }});
    // .mx__2 { background: red }
    // .mx__2 a:hover { color: blue }


## Vendor prefixing

The current vendor prefix is automatically detected, and then added to a number of pre-defined properties and property/value combinations. If you're missing a property, you can add it to the `marcssist._prefixed(Props|Values)` objects. See source code for format.

    mx.style({ columnCount: 2 }});
    // .mx__3 { -webkit-column-count: 2 }

Support for prefixed values is currently limited.


## Auto units

If a number is specified, it will be converted to a string with an appended unit. This is convenient for things like `{ padding: PADDING + 5 }`.
